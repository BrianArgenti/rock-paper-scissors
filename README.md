# rock-paper-scissors

A simple game that helped me with understanding the DOM and how to manipulate it
by injecting javascript. The original iteration of this project wasn't as complex
to set up but required more effort from the user. Now, instead of asking the user
to type in their choice, they only need press a button corresponding to their 
selection. My next goal is to work on the game's presentation because currently 
the game is bare-bones, purely made to show functionality.
