It's rock, paper, scissors in a web-browser. Need I say more?

For this project in its current form, the console must be open to see the functions working. There is some code in the html file but it is purely for labeling purposes. The score will update after the full game has been played and will not reset for a new game. That functionality will come later. For now, realtime scoring and messaging will appear in the console and the alert windows.
